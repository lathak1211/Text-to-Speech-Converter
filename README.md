# Text-to-Speech-Converter-
A text-to-speech (TTS) converter is a technology that vocalizes written text, making digital content accessible to a wider audience. This abstract details the development of a TTS converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core of the application is built with HTML to structure the user interface, providing input fields for text entry. CSS is utilized to style the interface, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing design. JavaScript, combined with the Web Speech API, forms the backbone of the TTS functionality, enabling the conversion of text input into audible speech. Users can input text into a designated area, and upon activation, the script processes the text and outputs the corresponding speech. This project demonstrates how web technologies can be leveraged to create an accessible, interactive tool, enhancing user experience and offering practical applications for those with visual impairments or reading difficulties.
